mother in Ireland? I’m not particular—the first that comes to hand in the bundle will
do.</p>

<p><i>Post.</i> No, I haven’t one for you.</p>

less. “Whittington Widgetts, Esquire, Hierokosma, Jarmyn Street.” Hierokosma! That’s
French for a tailor’s shop. By the Attorney-General ’twould give a man a headache in his
elbow to write such a cramp word. (<i>Smells the letter.</i>) Why then it smells elegant
intirely. (<i>Goes to door</i>, <small>R</small>.,<i> and enters while speaking.</i>) Mr.
Widgetts, here’s a letter for you, sir.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Returns immediately from the room, re-commences his song, and

eight.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> There, listen to that row. That master of mine will persist in calling me
Twill, though he knows my name is Barney Toole, because Twill, he says, is genteeler.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> What o’clock is that, Twill?</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Eight o’clock, sir.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Put up the shutters.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> What the devil can he mean? We never shut until nine o’clock.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> WIDGETTS <i>from chamber</i>, <small>R</small>.,
<i>kissing a note which he holds.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Well, don’t you hear me? Put up the shutters and close the establishment,
directly.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Of coorse, sir. Never say it twice.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Twill runs out by door</i>, <small>L</small>., <i>and is seen
putting up the window shutters outside.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> This night I devote to the tender union of love and lobsters. The adorable
Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce, the ballet dancer, at last consents to partake a little quiet
supper with me here this evening. I must read her charming note once more. (<i>Reads.</i>)
“Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce presents compliments to Mr. Whittington Widgetts, will feel happy
to sup with Mr. W. W. this evening. Ma’amselle C. B. fears that female notions don’t
correspond with supping with a single gent, but lobsters is stronger than prudence,
therefore trusts to indulgence; at nine o’clock precise. P.S.—I’ll come in my blue visite
and my native innocence, and hopes you’ll treat them with proper delicacy.” Glorious!
Angelic creature! (<i>Kisses the letter and puts it in his waistcoat pocket.</i>) Oh!
Widgetts, you lucky rascal, to have the happiness of a private and confidential supper
with that magnificent girl, whose image has never left my mind since the evening I danced
with her at the Casino. (<i>Calls.</i>) Twill!</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> (<i>entering from door</i>, <small>L</small>.) Sir?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> You must run directly to the tavern, over the way, and order them to send a
roast fowl and lobster, in the shell, here, at nine o’clock.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Roast fowl, sir?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> And lobster. He—hem! I expect a particular party to sup with me.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Coorse you’ll want cigars, sir?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No. The party, Twill, is a lady and don’t smoke.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> A lady! Tare my agers, sir. Does the lady bring the lady’s maid with
her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14-1">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Don’t be impertinent, Twill, but listen to me. The party I expect is
Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce, a splendid creature, who dances on a limited income, with the
strictest regard to propriety, at the Opera House, and gives lessons to private pupils in
the <i>pokar</i> and the waltz <i>ah do tongs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Whoo! She must be a switcher. (<i>Going.</i>) I’ll run directly, sir.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Stay! I must make myself attractive for the interesting occasion. Give me
the coat that has just been finished for Sir Chippin Porrage, and the waistcoat that’s to
be sent home to-morrow morning for the Honourable Cecil Harrowgate’s wedding. (<i>Twill
hands a dress coat and waistcoat from the table</i>, <small>L</small>.) I’ll give them an
air of gentility by wearing them this evening. That will do. There, be off now.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Ha, ha! By the powers o’ war, when you get them on your back, sir, you’ll
be like Mulligan’s dog, your own father wouldn’t know you.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Here, Twill, take my basket, good chap. Is master at home?</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> (<i>Takes basket.</i>) Yes, he <i>is</i> at home. (<i>Aside.</i>) Take my
basket, good chap. Well, there’s no bearing the impudence of the lower orders. (<i>Sets
down basket</i>, <small>R</small>., <i>and calls at door</i>, <small>R</small>.) Please,

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>entering</i>, <small>R</small>., <i>aside.</i>) She always comes at an
awkward crisis. (<i>Mary takes off her shawl and sits</i>, <small>L</small>.) Mary, my
dear, you’re rather late this evening.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh dear, yes! I’ve been half over the town for my customers’ washing, and
I’m almost tired to death, but I left yours for last, that we might have a comfortable
chat together. Stop a minute though till I take off my clogs.</p>

painfully familiar; she forgets that our positions are materially altered since I was a
journeyman tailor in a two pair back, struggling to make love and trousers for the small
remuneration of fifteen shillings a week. Mary White is an uncommon nice girl—as a
laundress, but my sentiments is changed respecting her as a wife.</p>

<p class="entrance">MARY WHITE<i> re-enters and comes down</i>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Now, Widgy, dear—— Oh, good gracious, what a love of a waistcoat you’ve
on! Let me look at it, do? Well, it’s a real beauty.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Stylish, eh? The last Paris touch.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> You used not to wear such waistcoats as that when you lived in Fuller’s
Rents.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Oh, no, no! Ha, ha! (<i>Aside.</i>) I wish she’d cut Fuller’s Rents.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Do you know, Widgy, I don’t think you’re at all improved since you fell in
for that fortune, by a legacy you never expected. When you lived in Fuller’s Rents you
used to walk out with me on a Sunday. You never walk with me at all now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14-2"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Walking’s vulgar, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> And you sometimes used to take me at half-price to the theatres.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Theatres is low, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> And you remember how we used to go together to Greenwich, with a paper of
ham sandwiches in my basket, and sit under the trees in the park, and talk, and laugh—law!
how we used to laugh to be sure!—and then you used to talk of love and constancy and
connubial felicitude in a little back parlour, and a heap of beautiful things.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) A heap of rubbish.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> And you know, Widgy, dear, when we enter that happy state——</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> What state do you allude to, Miss White?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> The marriage state, of course.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Oh, indeed. Ah!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> You don’t forget, I hope, that I have your promissory note on the back of
twenty-nine unpaid washing bills to make me your lawful wife. (<i>Produces several
papers.</i>) There they are—and there’s the last of them. (<i>Reads.</i>) “Six months
after date I promise to marry Miss Mary White.” There, sir, you’re due next Monday.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Am I! Then I’m afraid I sha’n’t be prepared to take myself up. I’ll let
myself be protested.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No, you sha’n’t; you’ve been protested often enough. I can’t be put off
any longer, and understand me, Mr. Widgetts, I <i>won’t</i> neither.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) There’s a savage hymeneal look in her eye that makes me
shiver in my Alberts. I must soothe her a little or I shall have a scene. Why, Mary, my
dear, now don’t be angry, you know it’s one of my jokes.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Well, you’d better not try any more of them, for I don’t like them. No
woman does.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, of course, no woman does. Ha, ha, ha! Quite proper too, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Well, now that matter’s settled, I’ll go and collect your soiled things,
for it’s getting late.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Do so, Mary; you’ll find them in my room as usual. (<i>Sits at table</i>,
<small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.) I’ll make out the list as you call them out. (<i>Mary
White enters room</i>, <small>R</small>., <i>and Widgetts prepares to write.</i>) She’s
resolved to make me her victim and I don’t know how to get rid of her. I’d give——</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Inside.</i>) Four shirts.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Writes.</i>) Four shirts. She’s a perfect treasure at shirt buttons;
but what is shirt buttons to a bosom that beats for another.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Inside.</i>) One false front.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Writes.</i>) One false front. She’d make a comfortable little wife if
she only had——</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Inside.</i>) A pair of white trousers.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Writes.</i>) A pair of white trousers. Ah! I wore those ducks at the
Casino last Wednesday, and Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce observed, while I was handing her a
glass of champagne—— Ecod, ’tis well I recollected it—I’ve forgotten to order champagne
for my supper. I must run over to the tavern myself and tell them to send some.</p>

<p class="direction_r">[<i>Snatches up his hat and exit</i>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Entering with the white waistcoat worn by Widgetts at first, and a
note in her hand.</i>) Well, you’re a pretty careless fellow, to leave your letters in
your waistcoat pocket. Where is he gone to? (<i>Examines the note curiously. Reads.</i>)
“Whittington Widgetts, Esq.” It’s a woman’s hand. I’ve a good mind to read it. I’ve no
secrets from him and he has none from me—or, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-15-1">[Pg 15]</a></span>at least he oughtn’t to—so it can be no harm. (<i>Opens
note and reads hastily.</i>) “Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce”—Ah!—“compliments—happy to sup with
Mr. W. W. this evening—female notions—single gent—lobsters is stronger than
prudence—therefore trusts to indulgence, at nine o’clock precise.” Oh, the minx!
(<i>Reads.</i>) “P.S.—I’ll come in my blue visite and my native innocence.” Oh, Widgetts,
the false deceitful wretch, to deceive me and wash out all his promises; to wring my heart
and mangle my affections like that. (<i>Sobbing.</i>) But I—I—don’t care not a pin’s
point; no, I despise him and hate him worse than poison, and I’ll—I’ll—I’ll—tell him so.

<p><i>Mary.</i> Then you want to see a good-for-nothing fellow.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Exactly, and I shouldn’t mind adding that I consider him an numbug.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> A wretch!</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Most decidedly.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> A puppy!</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Not a doubt of it. You see we’re unanimous in our verdict. That man,
ma’am, has been a <i>reptile</i> in my path, a <i>wiper</i> to all <i>my</i> hopes, and an
<i>adder</i> to all my woes; he has lacerated my heart and singed the tender buds of young

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah! What has he done?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> He has<i> done me</i>, ma’am—<i>me</i>, Brown; that’s what he’s done. Cut
me out with Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Cheri Bounce! Ah! (<i>Aside.</i>) She that’s to sup to-night with
Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> I’m an ’airdresser, ma’am, my name’s Brown, and I’ve a professional
engagement at the Opera House, where I cultivate romance and ringlets amongst the ladies
of the ballet. There I first beheld the lovely Cheri Bounce, the very image of the wax
Wenus in my shop window. I loved her, not for her foreign grace, but for her native hair.
Oh, she had such a head of real hair; and, oh, the showers of tears and the bottles of
Macassar oil that I’ve poured upon it nobody would believe! Well, I toasted her for two
years regularly, and at length she consented to become <i>Brown</i>. Well, we were to have
been married, I had bought my wedding suit, when this fellow Widgetts, came to take the
curl out of my happiness. We quarrelled about him last Saturday, and grew so warm that
we’ve been cool ever since. But that’s not all. This very day, I heard that she had
accepted an invitation to sup with him to-night; but I’ll prevent <i>that;</i> he shall
fight me—one of us must fall—let him choose his own weapons—curling irons if he likes.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Don’t be rash, Brown. Widgetts has deceived <i>me</i> and wronged
<i>you;</i> we must take a better way of being revenged on him.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> How? What way? Tell me! I’ll do anything to be down on Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Then you must assist me in a scheme I’ve just thought of. Here, carry this
stuffed gentleman into the kitchen there.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh, never mind; you’ll manage very well! There, make haste, and do as I

<p><i>Brown.</i> Well, I’m only made to order, so I’ll try and do my best.</p>

Poor dear soul. “But my ghost, and them lobsters will sit heavy on your stomach to-night.”
Horrible idea! It can’t be true—she’d never go to commit such a catastrophe in my
establishment. Make a coroner’s inquest of herself in my private water-butt, when the
Thames is open to all! No, she’s only said so to frighten me. (<i>Throws letter on the

dressed as a young man, and drying her hands with a towel.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Aside and laughing.</i>) Heavens, what a figure.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Hem! A——I beg your pardon—but you seem—a—eh——</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Exactly. And who are you?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Me—I—a—ah—I’m—a—the waiter—from the tavern.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Perhaps, then, you can tell me where I can find Mr. Widgetts?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Not exactly. You’ve particular business with him?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Rather. In fact—I don’t mind telling you—I’m one of the detective
police.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Alarmed.</i>) You!—a gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh, yes, we go about in all manner of disguises, when we want to pick up a
shy bird. Now, I’m looking for Widgetts, and I shouldn’t mind giving five pounds if you
could tell me where to lay my hand upon him.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Lays her hand on Widgetts’ shoulder, who starts.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ah! Ha, ha, ha! Five pounds! Is it a—very serious business, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Merely a hanging matter.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Nothing more? (<i>Aside.</i>) The dreadful deed’s discovered. I’ll be off.
Hem, well, I’ll go and look after Mr. Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No, no; you must stop here. I’ve no doubt I shall want you presently.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> MADEMOISELLE CHERI BOUNCE, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> I beg pardon.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Zounds! Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce.</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> I expected to meet a gent—Mr. Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Who invited you to supper?</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Crosses to</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18-1">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) How did the fellow know that?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> My friend, Widgetts, has been obliged to leave home rather suddenly, but
he has left me here to perform the agreeable for him. Supper, you see, is waiting,
Ma’amselle.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Coming forward.</i>) Allow me to observe——</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Lay the table.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) The rascal’s not going to eat my supper!</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Lays the table,</i> <small>C</small>.)</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Really a very nice young man.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> My name is Spraggs—Spraggs, ma’amselle. Like my friend, Widgetts, I’m
dotingly fond of the girls—aw—paws’itive fact—can’t help it, never could, and don’t think
I ever shall. Let me take your shawl. (<i>Takes off Cheri Bounce’s shawl.</i>) A divine
figure—demme!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Coming between them.</i>) Allow me to observe——</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Lay the table, waiter.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) D—n the table. (<i>Lays the plates and dishes and places
the chairs. Mary White gallants Mdlle. Cheri Bounce, apart. Widgetts</i>,
<small>C</small>., <i>polishing a plate, furiously.</i>) Here’s a pleasant situation,
waiter at my own supper, and afraid to open my mouth. The rascal’s making love to her, and
she likes it! Hang ’em, I wish I could strangle them.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Mary White and Mdlle. Cheri Bounce laughing.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Oh, you droll wretch, you’re ten times funnier than that stupid
Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Hang Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Coming between them.</i>) I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> What d’ye want? Is the table laid?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) D—n the table. (<i>Returns to table, and bawls out.</i>)
Supper’s ready!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah! (<i>To Cheri Bounce.</i>) Come, my dear.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Widgetts seats himself at table.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> What!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Jumps up.</i>) Beg pardon—I vacate.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Mary White</i>, <small>R</small>., <i>and Cheri Bounce</i>,
<small>L</small>., <i>seat themselves at table.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Now, my dear ma’amselle, here are fowl, and lobster, and kidneys.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I wish they were sticking in his gizzard.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Now then, waiter, be alive, and take your tin.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Claps one of the dish covers on Widgetts’ head, who snatches it
off, and flings it away in a rage.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Allow me to observe——</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> There’s no bread, my good fellow.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Coming. (<i>Aside.</i>) D—n the bread.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Goes to a table at back, on which is a loaf of bread and
rolls.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> What part of the fowl shall I send you, ma’amselle?</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> The funny idea, Mr. Spraggs, if you please.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> The funny idea! Well, I never!</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> The merry thought, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh, to be sure! Yes, the funny idea.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Cutting the fowl.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Bread.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Claps the loaf of bread on the dish before Mary White, who throws
it at him.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Roll, stupid. Plates, waiter. (<i>Widgetts puts the roll under his arm,
and hands plates to Mary White.</i>) Allow me to add a kidney. They look beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18-2"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Thank you.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Mary White puts some fowl and a sausage on the plate, which she
gives to Widgetts for Mdlle. Cheri Bounce, and then helps herself.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Comes down with the plate in his hand.</i>) How uncommon savoury it
smells. He’s not looking.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Takes the kidney off the plate, and puts it in his
pocket.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Waiter. (<i>Widgetts lays the plate before Mdlle. Cheri Bounce.</i>) Open
that champagne, waiter.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) My champagne, too!</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Opening a bottle of champagne.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Helps Mdlle. Cheri Bounce.</i>) I hope you liked your kidney.</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> What kidney, Mr. Spraggs?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Snatching the kidney out of his pocket, and putting it, unperceived, on
Mdlle. Cheri Bounce’s plate.</i>) Why, that kidney.</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Dear me, I didn’t perceive it before.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Widgetts places champagne on the table.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Celery, waiter. (<i>Widgetts goes to table at back for celery. Mary White

stalks of celery in his coat pocket, and, without being perceived, takes the champagne

Ma’amselle, this is rare fun.</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Glorious!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I’ll give you, the absent Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> I’ve no objection to drink poor Widgetts’ health, but I don’t at all wish
for his company. He’s such a particularly conceited fool.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside, and scarcely able to restrain himself.</i>) Do I look like a
fool? (<i>They drink. Widgetts comes to the table.</i>) As the sole surviving friend of
Mr. Widgetts, will you allow me to say——</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Presses the plate to his breast. Knock at door</i>,
<small>L</small>.)</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Hold your tongue and open the door.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Mary White and Ma’amselle Cheri Bounce rise.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Perhaps ’tis Widgetts.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> No, it isn’t. Widgetts is—elsewhere.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Knocking at door</i>, <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> (<i>Outside door.</i>) Open the door. I must come in.</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Heavens! That’s Brown’s voice. If he finds me here I shall be ruined.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Don’t let him in.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Runs to door</i>, <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Where on earth can I conceal myself? Ah, here! (<i>Throws open folding
doors. Widgetts stands transfixed with terror; Mdlle. Cheri Bounce screams in a state of
dreadful alarm.</i>) Oh, oh, oh! There’s a woman drowned in the water-butt.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> ’Tis Mary White, the laundress. Widgetts murdered her.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I’ll be d——d if he did!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Never mind, he’ll be hanged for it all the same.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Exit through folding-doors which she closes after her.</i></p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Widgetts hanged! You might as well hang me.</p>

door</i>, <small>L</small>., <i>Brown outside</i> <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Runs into chamber</i>, <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> BROWN, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Where is she? Where’s Mademoiselle Cheri Bounce? I know she’s here.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I beg your pardon, she left here half an hour ago! I called the cab for her
myself—a patent hansom, No. 749.</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Where’s Widgetts, then? Where’s the villain Widgetts, the destroyer of my
happiness?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> My good fellow, don’t be outrageous! Mr. Widgetts is unfortunately
absent—he’s gone to close the eyes of a dying uncle, and won’t be back to-night.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> TWILL, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Oh, please, sir, they wouldn’t admit the order at the Adelphi! (<i>Sees
Widgetts and bursts into a fit of laughter.</i>) Ha, ha, ha, ha! Why surely this ain’t Guy
Faux day, Mr. Widgetts?</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Widgetts!</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> (<i>At door</i>, <small>R</small>.) Widgetts?</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Retires.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Of course! That’s Mr. Widgetts, my master; I’ll never deny him.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) Then I’ve nothing for it but a bolt—out of my bedroom
window.</p>

Bounce screams inside. Widgetts rushes out again followed by Mdlle. Cheri Bounce beating
him with her umbrella.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Cheri.</i> Stop him! Don’t let him escape! He has murdered a woman.</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> Murdered a woman? Oh, the dirty blackguard, what a taste he had.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Brown attempts to seize him, but Widgetts strikes his hat over
his eyes, runs round the table, and runs to door</i>, <small>L</small>., <i>against which
Twill has placed his back.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> (<i>In a boxing attitude.</i>) No, you don’t.</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Brown now collars him, and Cheri Bounce beats him with her
umbrella.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Ha, have I got you at last—(<i>shaking him</i>)—villain!</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Help! Murder! Police! Help!</p>

<p><i>Twill.</i> (<i>Dancing at door</i>, <small>L</small>.) Police! Here’s an illigant
row. Go it, little one—fire away, umbrella! She don’t lay it into him at all.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Stop, stop, stop! Spare the remnant of an injured tailor’s life. You think
I cut off Mary White’s thread; but I didn’t! The horrid act was her own deed. She got
jealous of me, and mixed her proud spirit with too much water. She’d tell you so herself,
poor soul, if she could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19-2"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Speaking inside folding doors in a solemn voice.</i>) No, she
wouldn’t.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Angels and bannisters support me. (<i>Drops on his knees. Mdlle. Cheri
Bounce throws herself into the arms of Brown. General consternation.</i>) ’Tis her
voice—her ghost is come back to walk the earth in them green boots. Injured shade, speak
for me, if ghosts have parts of speech, and tell them I’m innocent.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Inside.</i>) You caused my death by your falsity.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> O-oh! I know it; but sooner than you should have made an object of
yourself, I’d have married you ten times over.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Inside.</i>) And would you marry me now, if I was living?</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I would—to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> (<i>Runs out.</i>) Then, Whittington, I’m your loving Mary again.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> (<i>Jumps up and tries to avoid her, she follows him.</i>) Hollo! No—keep
off. (<i>She embraces him.</i>) Hey! Bless me, you’re neither damp or dead; on the
contrary you’re remarkably warm and lively. But, are you sure you’re not a water nymph,
and that you have not got private apartments in the Thames or the New River?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> No, Widgy; don’t be afraid, ’twas only a trick of mine, to plague you for
your inconstancy. (<i>Pointing to water butt.</i>) She’s not <i>me</i>, but the dummy
figure, dressed up in some of my clothes.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Ah, I’ve been finely hoaxed! And where’s the detective policeman, that eat
my lobster, and drank my wine?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Why, of course, he’s here.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Points to herself.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> Oh, you villain! But what’s to be done with Brown?</p>

<p class="direction">(<i>Brown and Mdlle. Cheri Bounce, who have been conversing at the
back, during the later part of the dialogue, come down.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Brown.</i> Ask Ma’amselle here, for she’s consented to be Mrs. Brown, next Monday,
and as for this little affair of the supper I was in the plot with Mary.</p>

<p><i>Wid.</i> I hope you were not in the water-butt with her; but, never mind, I don’t
want any further explanation. I’ve had my lesson—(<i>to Audience</i>)—and I hope you have
all profited by it. Now, if there’s any single, good-looking young fellow here, wants a
bit of advice. Eh—there’s my friend, Smith. Smith, my dear boy, when you invite a female
friend to a quiet bit of supper, mind there’s no water-butt on the premises; and I mention
this confidentially to all you bachelors, if your laundress is young and pretty, you had
better pay your washing bills regularly; and don’t, like me, get yourself into a scrape,
by not knowing “How to Settle Accounts with Your Laundress.”</p>

the source text.</p>

<li>p. 15: to wring my heart and mangle my affections like that, (<i>Sobbing.</i>)—Changed
the comma after “that” to a period.</li>

<li>p. 15: (<i>Lays his hands on his bosom.</i>—Added a closing parenthesis for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 16: you don’t mean to say your agoing to sup here?—Changed “your” to “you’re”.</li>

<li>p. 16: (<i>Pushes her again into the chair.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>)—Deleted the opening
parenthesis before “<i>Aside</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 17: <i>Enter two</i> WAITERS, L, <i>carrying tray with supper, covered dishes,
plates, bottles, &amp;c.</i>—Inserted a period after “L”.</li>

<li>p. 17: Its only, “Coming, sir, in <i>one</i> minute...”—Changed “Its” to “It’s”.</li>

<li>p. 17: Pulls a handful of the hair out of the chair-seat, goes to to the

mark.</li>
